          <h3> Electronic Parking Brake</h3>A feature that allows you to engage
          or disengage the handbrake with the press of a button instead of
          pulling the lever.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Automatic Parking Assist</h3>
          Detects empty spots if youâ€™re moving slowly or stopped & helps you
          park without controlling steering. You still have to control
          accelerator & brakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Night Vision Assist</h3>
          An infrared camera that detects objects in the carâ€™s path that may not
          be visible to the naked eye, & sends the driver an alert on the
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</h3>
          System that continuously monitors tyre pressure in all 4 tyres and
          informs you on the cluster meter if it detects a drop in tyre
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Automatic Climate Control</h3>
          Works like a home AC and maintains the set temperature, thus saving
          fuel by switching compressor off when not needed.
